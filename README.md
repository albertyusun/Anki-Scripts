# Anki-Scripts
Anki is a program that uses evidence-based learning techniques to make learning anything easy. In other words, Quizlet on steroids.

Here are some scripts I developed to help my own learning. As of now, I've used Anki to study hanzi writing (Duke's Chinese 331D Course), Machine Learning (Duke Applied Machine Learning Course), and theatre lines for my acting class (Theater Studies 145S).
